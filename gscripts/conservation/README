These are methods to extract conservation

download_conservation.sh
a script to simplify downloading conservation from ucsc

index_conservation.sh
converts .gz files to .bz2 (because they're block-accessible)
then uses bzip-table utility from (https://bitbucket.org/james_taylor/seek-bzip2) to index
then generates a .index file with a bx script

this basically makes indexes according to these instructions:

maf_handler.py
uses indexed maf files to extract ranges, built from the Bio.Phylo and bx packages

maf_scorer.py
